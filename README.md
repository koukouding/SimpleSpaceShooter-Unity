# SimpleSpaceShooter-Unity-HomeWork
A Simple SpaceShooter game including Force System and Boss Fight, though both of them are simple too.
It is actually a college homework,thought I done the code by myself, the artwork is not mine, some of them are given from my teacher, Wang, and the rest of them are download from unity's official website.

There are five kinds of fire
1. single bullet
2. double bullet
3. triple bullet
4. grenade
5. missile
